## Dataset

Our dataset is available for academic research. To acquire this dataset, please download this <a href="MRCD_Dataset_Agreement.pdf" target="_blank">**agreement**</a>, read it carefully and send it back to <a href="mailto:sireerw@gmail.com">**us**</a> with the signature of the director of your school or your institution. For copyright protection, we only accept the application from the director of your school or your institution.

Our dataset includes the facial scans of 438 subjects. For each subject, we capture 20 expressions. The synthetic relighting dataset is rendered using the scans of 100 subjects, which includes 270,000 valid image groups for training and 20,00 valid image groups for testing. 

> Some data is still under the examinations in SenseTime. Currently, we can provide the scans of 270 subjects. The relighting dataset includes the images of 80 subjects.
> 
> **As the agreement is based on the entire dataset, you do not need to sign the agreement again for the data released in the future.**
